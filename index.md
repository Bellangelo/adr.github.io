# Architectural Decision Records

An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. 
An [architecturally significant requirement (ASR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality. 
An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes.
All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM). Note: this short intro to ADRs is based on information in [this repo](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/01cc3c801b1cc61f82391a0a08986e4145e21c56/README.md)

The aim of the [GitHub adr organization](http://github.com/adr) is to
(i) strenghten the tooling around ADRs and to
(ii) provide provide pointers to public knowledge in the context of ADRs.

We currently focus on the [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) by Zdun et al., but are open to other formats of ADRs as shown at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>.

We offer one tool for sustainable ADs: [Embedded Architectural Decisions](https://github.com/adr/embedded-adl), which shows how ADRs can be embedded in Java Code.
