# Architectural Decision Records

An architectural decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.
An architectural decision record (ADR) is a way to track an AD, such as by writing notes, or logging information.
An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture.
All these are within the topic of architectural knowledge management (AKM). [source](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/01cc3c801b1cc61f82391a0a08986e4145e21c56/README.md)

The aim of the [GitHub adr organization](http://github.com/adr) is to
(i) strenghten the tooling around ADRs and to
(ii) provide provide pointers to all avaiable public knowledge in the context of ADRs.

We currently focus on the [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) by Zdun et al., but are open to other formats of ADRs as shown at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>.

We offer one tool for sustainable ADs: [Embedded Architectural Decisions](https://github.com/adr/embedded-adl), which shows how ADRs can be embedded in Java Code.
